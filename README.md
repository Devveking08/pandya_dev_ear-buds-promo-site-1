# Assignment: Creating a Website for Earbuds with Best Practices

## Overview

The primary objective of this assignment is to develop a website for showcasing earbuds created using motion design. We aim to implement industry best practices learned in our authoring class. This website will feature a model viewer, a scrollbar image, videos, color schemes, and interactive content using GSAP animations.

## Project Details

### Website Components
1. **Model Viewer:** We will integrate a model viewer to showcase our earbuds in a visually engaging manner.
2. **Scrollbar Image:** A scrollbar image will enhance the user experience, making navigation more intuitive.
3. **Videos:** We will incorporate videos into the website, with one currently being a placeholder for demonstration purposes.
4. **Color Schemes:** Attention will be given to harmonious color schemes that align with the earbuds' branding.

### Interactive Scrolling
To provide an engaging user experience, we will implement GSAP animations to create smooth scrolling effects. Content will dynamically appear as the user scrolls through the website. Currently, a boxed layout serves as a preliminary representation of our intentions, defined using the 'em' unit.

## Initial Phase

In the initial phase of the project, Professor Rob advised us to establish a responsive box layout as a foundation for our website. This layout will ensure that our content adapts effectively to various screen sizes and devices.

## Special Thanks

We would like to express our gratitude to Professor Rob for his invaluable assistance in answering our questions and providing feedback on this assignment. We highly value and appreciate his support.
